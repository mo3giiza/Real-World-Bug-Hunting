- **Vulnerabillties And Bug Bounties**
    - **Vulnerability**
        
        > *Is a weakness in an application that allows a malicious person to perform some malicious actions or gain access to information they shouldn’t allowed to access.*

    - **[VDP Vs BBP](https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/vdp-vs-bbp.html)**
        
        > *VDP does not offer payment (though a company may award swag).*
        > 
        
        > *BBPs have the option to be private or public and offer payments.*

- ****Client side vs. Server side****
    
    > **Client side and server side describe where web application code runs.**
    > 
    
    > **On a dynamic website there are client-side and server-side scripts. Client-side and server-side are sometimes referred to as front-end and back-end. The client-side of a website refers to the web browser and the server-side is where the data and source code is stored.**

    - **Protocols**
        - **RFC**
            
            > *A Request for Comments (RFC) is a formal document that contains specifications and organizational notes about topics related to the internet and computer networking, such as routing, addressing and transport technologies.*
            > 
            
        - **HTTP**
            
            > *The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load web pages using hypertext links.*
            > 
        - **HTTPS**
            
            > *Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of (HTTP), which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer.*
            > 
            
        - **IP**
            
            > *The Internet Protocol (IP) is a set of requirements for addressing and routing data on the Internet. IP can be used with several transport protocols, including TCP and UDP.*
            > 
            - **IPv4**
                
                > A*re structured as four numbers connected by periods, and each number falls in a range from 0 to 255.*
                > 
            - **IPv6**
                
                > I*s the newest version of the Internet Protocol. It was designed to address the problem of available IPv4 addresses running out. IPv6 addresses are made up of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons, but methods exist to shorten IPv6 addresses. For example, 8.8.8.8 is an IPv4 address, and 2001:4860:4860::8888 is a shortened IPv6 address.*
                > 
            
        - **DNS**
            
            *The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like google.com.*
            
- **MIME Sniffing**
    
    > I*s a technique used to determine the content type of an HTTP response using the first few bytes of the actual content, Applications can disable this browser
    behavior by including the header X-Content-Type-
    Options: nosniff.*

    > **1. You type a URL in your browser and press Enter**
    > 
    
    > **2. Browser looks up IP address for the domain**
    > 
    
    > **3. Browser initiates TCP connection with the server**
    > 
    
    > **4. Browser sends the HTTP request to the server**
    > 
    
    > **5. Server processes request and sends back a response**
    > 
    
    > **6. Browser renders the content**

- **HTTP Methods**
    
    > **HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.**
    > 
    
    | GET | Requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GETshould only retrieve data. |
    | --- | --- |
    | POST | Submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server. |
    | HEAD | Method asks for a response identical to a GET
     request, but without the response body. |
    | PUT | Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload. |
    | DELETE | Deletes the specified resource. |
    | CONNECT | Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource. |
    | OPTIONS | Describes the communication options for the target resource. |
    | TRACE | Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource. |
    | PATH | Applies partial modifications to a resource. |
